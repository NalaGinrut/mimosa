I want to enclose all the platform-dependency code into a "bsp" dir. That contains only HEAD file(for define consts) and ASSEMBLEY code(for low-level functions).
Maybe I should do that latter. Because it causes deeper dirs tree. Hardly handle that with git-mv if just do a little for each time.

[Makefile]:
I think there would be a "make fix-tree" to ensure all the kernel file tree is valid before run "make kernel".

[platform]:
This dir is used for containning BSP file. We just modify the files within this dir while we do some port work. And I think it would be a great idea if we just put header file & assembly code into it. We'd better avoid using C code within this dir because it's determined the performance of this OS. Anyway, write some assembly code just in this dir is easier relativly.
I SAID LAUDLY AGAIN: all assembly code & platform-dependency code must be put in this platform directory! There is NO OTHER dir to place them!!

[bsp_xxx.h]:
These files should be a generic bsp framework, any part of the OS could reference these file. They followed a fixed format. We call it BSP framework.

[paging]
The paging of x86 cpu is more complicated, we may implement a simple fixed paging mode first, for instance ,32-bit paging. And maybe implement others later......

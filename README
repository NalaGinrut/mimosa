Mimosa is a practice of MIT-OCE OSE 6.828.
It's complete under GPL and FREE. And it's a HFG's official project. We wrote it for Educational practice.

I plan to finish this OS(acctually, make it work) till the life. And we may design a more complex and more interesting OS based on this cute OS. It's just a Guinea pig.

* cprintf get error arg_list order occasionally, e.g:
  -------------------------
  kprintf("%d %d\n" ,a ,b)
  -------------------------	       
  Could print as "b a".
  But for most situations it's OK. I didn't find out the reason.
  It first occurs when platform/pc32/pmap.c (pmap_page_remove: #3) debug printing.
